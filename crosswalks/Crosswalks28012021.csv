"The tab ""crosswalks"" collates available mappings (either from the survey or from recommendation) to schema.org.

How are properties from schema.org chosen (V0.2):
Row3-42 (except row 6): Properties of the types ""CreativeWork"" and ""Thing"" are from CodeMeta (https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/blob/master/crosswalk.csv). 
Properties of the type ""dataset"" are from dcat (Figure 6, https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#dcat-sdo). 
Properties 43-45 are from Google dataset seach guide (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset), these three properties are not covered by CodeMeta (this is added on 13 Feb. 2020, after Penny collated the crosswalks)
Properties from the row 46 and onward are added when properties from source schemes can't be found from the row 3-42. 

Rows in green color are covered by the Google dataset search guide - they are 20 in total.  The three rows in dark green are ""Required"",  the other rows in light green are ""Recommended"". 

2020-09-04 (changes made by Mingfang Wu to the tab: crosswalks)
* Readjust the schema.org columns (B-E), the version before this date is named: V0.2 - before-alighment 20200903. The Keep proprties from the v0.2 are largely from the CodeMeta Properties.
* After the adjustment, keep the 20 properties from google, added properties from DCAT & DCAT-AP (dataset, datacatalogy and distribution) - the properties that can be mapped to schema.org are in orange color, the properties can't find proper mapping to shema.org are in color, and properties not in DCAT/DCAT-AP but used by other schemas are in color grey. 
* Add the SPACE column. SPACE data model is available at: https://spase-group.org/data/model/index.html Baptiste Cecconi (LESIA, Observatoire de Paris, CNRS, PSL Research University) contributed the mapping here.
